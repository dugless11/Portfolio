This is practice create task that my teacher assign to us for project management practice and actual software dev as practice for the AP CSP create performance task.
Instructions are in game.
Some stuff I didn't tell you but you should figure it out
wait - does nothing for a turn
attack - does damage based on strength uses 1 sp
recover - recovers sp based on recovery 
defend - reduces damage taken by defense uses 1 sp
run - chance to escape based on hp
beating a fight will give you an item
you can rest, change equipment, or continue
rest restores hp and sp
change equipment allows you to change equipement(the ui is terrible, I know but time management, I don't want to deal with all that)
Weapons increase strength
Accesory increases recovery
Defense(great name I know) increases defense
also you innately take less damage from attacks with high defense
also there is a min damage(the text would say "attacked unsuccessfully" and you do 1 hp and you take 5hp recoil)
also you take 5hp recoil if you try and attack or defend with no sp
also every 5 fights you fight a boss enemy with better stats
also built-in difficulty ramp
